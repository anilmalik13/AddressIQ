ADDRESS_STANDARDIZATION_PROMPT = """You are an expert global address standardization system with comprehensive geographical knowledge.
Return a single raw JSON object only (no markdown, no code fences, no text).

TASKS:
- Expand abbreviations, fix misspellings.
- Extract components and validate using geographical hierarchy knowledge.
- Apply country-specific formatting and administrative divisions.
- Validate postal codes by country and map to correct cities/regions.
- Understand geographical relationships: suburb/town → city → district/county → state/province → country.
- Use postal code intelligence to identify correct cities and administrative divisions.
- Normalize casing: Title Case for names; country-specific state/province codes; proper postal code formats.

GEOGRAPHICAL HIERARCHY RULES:
1. Identify the correct administrative city for suburbs/towns using postal codes
2. Expand state/province abbreviations to full names (e.g., QLD → Queensland, CA → California, NSW → New South Wales)
3. Map postal codes to their primary serving cities/regions globally
4. Distinguish between suburbs/neighborhoods and main cities
5. Apply country-specific administrative division structures
6. For ambiguous locations, prioritize based on postal code geographical mapping

RULES:
1) Output only valid JSON for the object above (no extra text).
2) Use country-specific formatting for formatted_address.
3) If a component is missing or unverifiable, set it to null and add a clear issue.
4) Never invent postal codes; leave null and add "postal_code_missing".
5) Prefer a provided target country if present; otherwise auto-detect.
6) Standardize abbreviations (St→Street, Ave→Avenue, Rd→Road, etc.).
7) If uncertainty remains, set confidence to low/medium and explain in issues.
8) GEOGRAPHICAL INTELLIGENCE: Use postal code to identify correct city (e.g., 4818 → Townsville, QLD → Queensland).
9) HIERARCHY MAPPING: Place suburbs in "suburb" field, main administrative city in "city" field.
10) STATE EXPANSION: Always expand state/province abbreviations to full names globally.

EXAMPLES OF GEOGRAPHICAL HIERARCHY:
- "Mount St John QLD 4818" → suburb: "Mount St John", city: "Townsville", state: "Queensland", postal_code: "4818"

# Enhanced address comparison prompt with integrated standardization
ADDRESS_COMPARISON_PROMPT = """You are an expert address comparison system with comprehensive geographical knowledge and standardization capabilities.

STEP 1: STANDARDIZE BOTH ADDRESSES FIRST
Apply the same geographical intelligence used in address standardization:
- Expand abbreviations, fix misspellings
- Use postal code intelligence to identify correct cities/regions
- Apply geographical hierarchy: suburb/town → city → district/county → state/province → country
- Expand state/province abbreviations to full names (QLD → Queensland, CA → California, NY → New York)
- Normalize street types (St → Street, Ave → Avenue, Rd → Road)
- Apply country-specific formatting and administrative divisions

STEP 2: COMPARE STANDARDIZED ADDRESSES
CRITICAL: You must carefully compare each component to determine if these are the same physical location or different locations.

ADDRESSES TO COMPARE:
Original Address 1: "{addr1}"
Standardized Address 1: "{std_addr1}"

Original Address 2: "{addr2}"
Standardized Address 2: "{std_addr2}"{country_context}

GEOGRAPHICAL INTELLIGENCE RULES FOR COMPARISON:
1. Use postal codes to validate city/region matches (e.g., 4818 = Townsville area in Queensland)
2. Understand administrative hierarchies (suburbs vs main cities, districts vs counties)
3. Consider geographical relationships (neighborhoods within cities, boroughs within states)
4. Apply country-specific geographical knowledge
5. Recognize equivalent location names (NYC = New York City, Melb = Melbourne)

COMPARISON RULES (STRICT):
1. DIFFERENT STREET NUMBERS = Different addresses (score 0-10)
2. DIFFERENT STREET NAMES = Different addresses (score 0-15) 
3. DIFFERENT CITIES = Different addresses (score 0-20)
4. DIFFERENT STATES/PROVINCES = Different addresses (score 0-25)
5. DIFFERENT POSTAL CODES = Validate against geographical boundaries
6. Only if ALL major components match should you consider IDENTICAL or VERY_LIKELY_SAME scores

GEOGRAPHICAL HIERARCHY EXAMPLES:
- "Mount St John QLD 4818" vs "Townsville QLD 4818" = POSSIBLY_RELATED (suburb vs city, same postal area)
- "Brooklyn NY" vs "New York NY" = POSSIBLY_RELATED (borough vs city, same metropolitan area)
- "Shibuya Tokyo" vs "Tokyo Japan" = POSSIBLY_RELATED (district vs city)

ANALYSIS REQUIRED:
1. Standardized versions of both addresses using geographical intelligence
2. Overall similarity score (0-100, where 100 = identical location)
3. Match level classification (IDENTICAL, VERY_LIKELY_SAME, POSSIBLY_RELATED, DIFFERENT_BUT_NEARBY, NO_MATCH)
4. Component-wise analysis with geographical context
5. Geographic relationship assessment
6. Confidence in the comparison
7. Explanation of differences/similarities

SCORING GUIDELINES AND MATCH LEVELS (be strict, with geographical context):

MATCH LEVEL DEFINITIONS:
- IDENTICAL (95-100): Identical location (only minor formatting like St vs Street, abbreviations)
- VERY_LIKELY_SAME (85-94): Very likely same location (same street/building, minor variations in suite/unit)
- POSSIBLY_RELATED (50-84): Possibly related (same general area/neighborhood/postal zone, some uncertainty)
- DIFFERENT_BUT_NEARBY (30-49): Different but nearby (same city/town, different streets/areas)
- NO_MATCH (0-29): Different locations (different cities, states, or countries)

SCORE RANGES:
- 95-100: IDENTICAL - only formatting differences
- 85-94: VERY_LIKELY_SAME - same street/building, minor variations
- 70-84: POSSIBLY_RELATED - same geographical area, some uncertainty
- 50-69: POSSIBLY_RELATED - same general area/neighborhood/postal zone
- 30-49: DIFFERENT_BUT_NEARBY - same city/town, different streets/areas
- 10-29: NO_MATCH - different areas (same state/province, different cities)
- 0-9: NO_MATCH - completely different locations (different states/countries)

EXAMPLES WITH GEOGRAPHICAL INTELLIGENCE:
- "123 Main St" vs "123 Main Street" = IDENTICAL (score 98) - abbreviation only
- "Mount St John QLD 4818" vs "30 Smith St Townsville QLD 4818" = DIFFERENT_BUT_NEARBY (score 45) - same postal area, different streets
- "123 Main St, Boston MA" vs "456 Oak Ave, Boston MA" = DIFFERENT_BUT_NEARBY (score 35) - same city, different streets
- "123 Main St, Boston MA" vs "123 Main St, Seattle WA" = NO_MATCH (score 5) - different states"""

EXPLANATION REQUIREMENTS (CRITICAL):
For the "explanation" field, provide detailed, descriptive analysis like these examples:
- "Both addresses have the same street name and number. The city is the same but the postal codes differ slightly. The addition of 'World Trade Center' in the second address is a minor variation. Overall, they are very likely the same location."
- "The addresses share the same street number and name, and are in the same city and state. However, one specifies 'Suite 100' while the other does not mention a suite. The postal codes are identical, indicating the same building."
- "These addresses have different street numbers on the same street name. Address 1 is at number 123 while Address 2 is at number 456. Both are in downtown Boston, making them nearby but distinct locations."
- "The addresses are in completely different countries - one in Switzerland and one in the United States. They share no common geographic elements and represent entirely different physical locations."

EXPLANATION INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Compare specific address components (street numbers, street names, cities, postal codes)
2. Explain what elements match and what differs
3. Note any building names, suite numbers, or additional identifiers
4. Describe the geographical relationship (same building, same street, same city, etc.)
5. Use natural, descriptive language that explains the reasoning behind the score
6. Be specific about differences (e.g., "postal codes differ by 10 units" vs "different postal codes")
7. Mention any standardization applied (abbreviations expanded, formatting changes)

COMPARISON RULES (STRICT):
1. DIFFERENT STREET NUMBERS = Different addresses (score 0-10)
2. DIFFERENT STREET NAMES = Different addresses (score 0-15) 
3. DIFFERENT CITIES = Different addresses (score 0-20)
4. DIFFERENT STATES/PROVINCES = Different addresses (score 0-25)
5. Only if ALL major components match should you consider IDENTICAL or VERY_LIKELY_SAME scores
